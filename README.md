# MonasteryRL
MonasteryRL is a basic roguelike that I've been developing with the TE4 Engine as a way to learn the engine and what its capable of.
The game is a simple dungeon delver. You play as a Paladin of the Holy Order sent to eradicate a cultist infestation of an abandoned Monastery.

Combat stats are gained via page drops that the various denziens of the Monastery drop. Once equipped they will give you various stat buffs.
The game is melee focused, and is a relatively short experience.
